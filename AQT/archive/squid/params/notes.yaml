# Mask Code 
Goal 1  
Make the mask 

Goal 2 
Check the resonator frequency of each resonator, 
the g (coupling) of the resonator and the bus -- gives the Quality Factor Q of the resonator 

Goal 3
Simulation

Goal 4
Fabrication 

Goal 5
Make any changes as necessary \& repeat 


## Fluxonium  Fishbone Code 
- Fix evaporation bumps, Make array junction pads connected to junction array 
- Make the gaps between junction array adjustable 
- Make the bottom connection width adjustable 
- Make all par.meters adjustable with fluxonium fixing itself accordingly 
- Add undercut around dolan leads
