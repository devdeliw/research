### my undergraduate research 

`muLab` is my research with JWST at muLab where I write algorithms to analyze
starclusters near the Galactic Center. I am currently working on deriving
position-dependent extinction laws of the area within 140" around Sag A*. 

`AQT` is my research at Berkeley Lab's Advanced Quantum Testbed, where I just
write software to generate masks and model fluxonium, or multi-fluxonium qubit
chips.
